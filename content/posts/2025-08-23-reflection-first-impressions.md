# Reflection: First Impressions of Cybersecurity

This week I went from *zero* to at least having a working lab environment. Docker is running, Juice Shop is installed, and Jupyter is ready to go. Honestly, this felt like a big win already — but it also came with a few surprises.

## What felt exciting
- Realizing how easy Docker makes things once it’s installed.
- Seeing Juice Shop running in the browser — it feels like I have my own little “cyber range.”
- Getting my first taste of Jupyter and imagining using it later for testing and notes.

## What felt confusing
- Docker permissions on macOS had me scratching my head for a bit.
- I don’t fully understand what Jupyter will be used for yet — but I trust it’ll become clear.

## Takeaway
Cybersecurity feels less mysterious when you break it into small wins. Having the lab ready means I can focus on learning skills instead of fighting with setup.
