# Kickoff & Ground Rules

{{< img src="/screenshots/2025-08-18_kickoff_01.png" alt="GroundUp Kickoff" width="816" >}}

## Why this series exists
The goal is simple: learn cybersecurity and AI from scratch, in public. Each week will include one reproducible lab and one reflection post. Every mistake, fix, and breakthrough will be documented.

## Ground rules
- Practice only on safe labs or your own systems.
- Blur secrets in screenshots before publishing.
- Always write down mistakes and how they were fixed.

## Cadence
Two posts per week: one hands-on lab and one "what I learned" reflection.

## Success metric
One screenshot-backed win per week.

## Tooling list
- A terminal
- Git
- Docker
- Python 3.11+
- VS Code
- Browser with DevTools


## Takeaways
- Documenting in public accelerates learning.
- Safe practice environments keep things ethical.
- Consistency beats intensity at this stage.
