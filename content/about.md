# About GroundUp

Welcome to **GroundUp: Security & AI from Scratch**. This site documents my journey as a beginner learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

## The Mission
- Learn by doing, in public.
- Share each step honestly — including mistakes, fixes, and wins.
- Create reproducible labs that others can follow.
- Show that it’s possible to get started without being an expert.

## About Me
I don’t come from a security or AI background. This blog is my way of exploring the basics, asking questions, and building projects one piece at a time.

**Current focus:**
- Running hands-on cybersecurity labs (Juice Shop, DVWA, and others)
- Understanding AI models and prompt engineering
- Publishing two posts each week: one lab and one reflection

## Ethics
Security work carries responsibility. Everything here is done within a safe and legal context:
- Only practice on intentionally vulnerable labs or my own systems
- Blur or remove any secrets in screenshots
- Share knowledge responsibly
